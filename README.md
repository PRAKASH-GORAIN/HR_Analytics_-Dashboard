# HR_Analytics_Dashboard

 --I created a comprehensive HR dashboard using Excel. 
 --It features KPIs like total employees, average age, attrition rate, and job satisfaction ratings.
 --I analyzed gender distribution, education fields, and average working years for each department. 
 --With interactive filters for education, rating, and department, this dashboard allows for deeper insights into employee data and attrition trends, empowering HR teams to make informed decisions.
